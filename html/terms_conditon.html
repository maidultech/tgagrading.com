                <h1>TGA Terms and Conditions</h1>
                <p>Last Updated: October 7 2024</p>
                <p>
                    The TGA Grading Services are provided by True Grade Authentication Inc. d/b/a True Grade
                    Authentication (“We” or “TGA”) and are subject to these terms and conditions (the “TGA Terms”) and
                    further guidelines and instructions applicable to the TGA authentication, grading, certification,
                    and related services (collectively, the “TGA Grading Services”) including the applicable service
                    fees, prices, rates, and charges provided for the TGA Grading Services, as well as the TGA User
                    Agreement (“User Agreement”) (incorporated herein by this reference) (these TGA Terms and the User
                    Agreement, collectively the “Terms”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    PRIOR TO USING ANY TGA GRADING SERVICES, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THE TERMS. As part of making a
                    submission to TGA, you must read and affirmatively agree to these TGA Terms to complete an order.
                    You agree to abide by and to be bound by these Terms and further agree that TGA is entitled to rely
                    upon and benefit from this agreement, as part of the submission process. If you do not agree to the
                    Terms, then you should not submit any item to TGA or otherwise request or use any TGA Grading
                    Services. Should you object to any of the Terms, or any subsequent modifications thereto, or become
                    dissatisfied with the TGA Grading Services, your sole remedy is to discontinue use of the TGA
                    Grading Services and request return of your item(s), as applicable, in the manner provided in the
                    Terms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    THE USER AGREEMENT CONTAINS A DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION PROVISION (SECTION 17) THAT GOVERNS
                    HOW CLAIMS YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED. READ THE TERMS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY
                    CONTAIN: (I) LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMERS REGARDING RISK OF LOSS AND DAMAGES; AND (II) A
                    PROVISION REQUIRING ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES BETWEEN US, INSTEAD OF CLASS ACTIONS OR JURY TRIALS.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We reserve the right to update and make changes to the Terms at any time by updating this posting or
                    providing notice to you electronically or as otherwise permitted under applicable law. Updates and
                    changes take effect when we post them, unless we specify an effective date in our notice to you.
                    Your continued access to or use of your Account and the TGA Grading Services after any updates
                    and/or changes indicates your acceptance to the Terms as modified. We may also ask you to
                    acknowledge your acceptance of the Terms through an electronic click-through. It is your
                    responsibility to periodically visit this page and review the Terms for updates.
                </p>
                <p>The TGA Grading Services are subject to the specific terms and conditions provided below. Capitalized
                    terms not otherwise defined below are defined in the User Agreement and incorporated here by this
                    reference. </p>
                <p>A. Authentication and Grading Services</p>
                <p>
                    1. Eligibility for Submission. To use the TGA Grading Services, you must (a) have a valid and active
                    TGA Account (“Account”) and have affirmatively agreed to the TGA User Agreement and (b) complete in
                    full the TGA Online Submission process, including selection of the applicable services, grading
                    submission type and label placement (as applicable). Eligible customers may create a TGA Account.
                    Only authorized dealers who have completed and signed a TGA Dealer Application and are appointed by
                    TGA as a TGA dealer are authorized to submit items to TGA for grading on behalf of individuals,
                    subject to the terms of the TGA Dealer Agreement. Submissions on behalf of group submitters or on
                    behalf of other dealers are expressly prohibited.
                </p>
                <p>Each person may only have a single TGA Account. If your TGA Account is canceled, disabled, blocked,
                    or otherwise restricted by TGA or its affiliate(s), you may not submit under another account. Any
                    account created by or on behalf of a person whose account was previously restricted is invalid. TGA
                    reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, and will refuse service to any person associated
                    with a duplicate or otherwise invalid TGA Account.</p>
                <p>Each order submitted for TGA Grading Services may only include a single service type (e.g., Grading,
                    Crossover, Review, or Reholder) and item type (e.g., Trading Cards, Tickets, Autographs, Packs, or
                    Funko Pop!), and must be shipped apart from any other order. If a submission is received for mixed
                    services or item types, TGA may, without notification, separate the items for processing according
                    to TGA submission requirements. If your submission is not in conformity with the Terms or TGA's
                    written submission instructions, TGA reserves the right to (a) reject and return the item submitted
                    by you at your risk and expense (as provided in these Terms); or (b) process the submission and
                    correct any non-conformity (including to reflect its current service and shipping prices) without
                    notice to you.</p>
                <p>2. Service Levels and Declared Value. TGA offers various turnaround time and pricing combinations
                    (“Service Levels”) depending on the type of item(s) you submit. The Service Level you select must
                    allow a maximum Declared Value greater than or equal to the Declared Value of each item in your
                    order. “Declared Value” is your estimate of the value of your submitted item after it has been
                    authenticated and graded by TGA. For additional information regarding Declared Values, refer to the
                    FAQ on TGA's website. Any Service Levels stated on the TGA website are provided for the convenience
                    of our customers only. Orders that require special handling or that have payment or shipping issues
                    may experience delays from the published Service Levels. TGA may offer certain Service Levels
                    exclusively to subscribers of a TGA membership program according to the terms of such program (see
                    Section 20).</p>
                <p>If TGA determines, in its sole discretion at any point in the process, your stated Declared Value
                    understates the fair market value of any item, TGA reserves the right to decline your stated
                    Declared Value and require you to pay a revised grading fee at a Service Level which has a maximum
                    Declared Value in excess of the item’s fair market value as determined by TGA. If you refuse or are
                    unable to pay TGA for the revised Service Level, then TGA will return your submitted item to you
                    unprocessed at your cost, and you will be charged the Service Level at which you submitted the item.
                    Additionally, TGA reserves the right to refuse to grade any item TGA determines to be grossly
                    overvalued by you based on the Declared Value.</p>
                <p>3. Turnaround Times. Any time frame proposed for TGA Grading Services on a submitted item, including
                    any estimated turnaround time for a Service Level, is an estimate only and is not guaranteed. Actual
                    time frames are based on when a submitted item is processed for TGA Grading Services and not when a
                    package is received, and may be impacted by, TGA's submission volume and capacity and other
                    unforeseen circumstances. Actual time frames may change without notice as conditions change. TGA
                    will endeavor to provide the TGA Grading Services within the time frame, if any, offered as part of
                    the TGA Grading Services at the requested Service Level. HOWEVER, WITHOUT LIMITING THE TERMS OF THE
                    USER AGREEMENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT TGA WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY
                    WHATSOEVER TO YOU OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES (DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR
                    CONSEQUENTIAL) DUE TO TGA'S FAILURE TO GRADE ANY ITEMS WITHIN ANY SPECIFIC TIME FRAME. ALL DAYS
                    REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS OR WITH THE TGA GRADING SERVICES REFER TO BUSINESS DAYS (UNLESS OTHERWISE
                    STATED).</p>
                <p>TGA will make your results available to you on the TGA website (accessible via a valid TGA Account
                    login). Customers may not contact the TGA offices for results before TGA makes them available.
                    Absolutely no authentication or grading results will be given over the phone, email, via any TGA
                    messaging portal, or any other method.</p>
                <p>4. Eligible Items and Services. TGA will provide the TGA Grading Services on items submitted to it by
                    you in accordance with the applicable TGA authentication, grading, and/or certification standards in
                    effect at that time. TGA may from time to time change the item types eligible for submission, the
                    types of service offered, and the specific elements of each service. The most up-to-date
                    descriptions of the specific TGA Grading Services currently offered may be found in the submission
                    flow (including tooltips and linked FAQs).
                    TGA will not grade items which bear evidence of trimming, recoloring, restoration, or any other form
                    of alteration or tampering, or that are of questionable authenticity, and you agree not to knowingly
                    submit any such items. Encapsulated items (e.g., those submitted for Review or Reholder services) in
                    holders that are open, unsealed, or otherwise showing evidence of tampering, fraud or damage, are
                    subject to new authentication and grading, and may be deemed inauthentic or receive a lower grade.
                    TGA may refuse to authenticate, grade, re-encapsulate, or certify items that are in its opinion
                    critically damaged and/or too fragile, or may alternatively require that you release TGA completely
                    from all liability whatsoever with regard to such items prior to performing the services by signing
                    a Release of Claims Agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. General Shipping Requirements. You agree(a) to pack and ship each item you submit to TGA in
                    strict accordance with all applicable submission instructions and requirements (including without
                    limitation those in your Submission Form, the TGA Shipping); and (b) to be charged one or more
                    processing fees for non-conforming packaging of any item, order, or group of orders, as disclosed in
                    the Shipping Guide. For avoidance of doubt, “non-conforming packaging” includes, but is not limited
                    to, submission of items in incorrect materials (e.g., rigid “toploader” sleeves), inclusion of
                    extraneous materials (e.g., pull tabs or stickers), submission of items in a different order than
                    that on the Submission Form, bundling of multiple orders, and any other deviation from the Shipping
                    Guide instructions published at TGAcard.com at the time your submit your order.

                    Carriers to whom you entrust your inbound items do not represent and do not act as an agent of TGA.
                    TGA shall have no liability whatsoever for (a) any damage to any item while in transit to TGA, (b)
                    any damage caused as a result of packing that does not strictly conform to our written
                    specifications (including such damage occurring in the course of unpacking), or (c) any damage to or
                    loss of extraneous objects (e.g., binders, frames) included with a submitted item. Regardless of the
                    method of transportation you utilize for delivery of your item(s) to TGA, you bear the sole cost and
                    risk of: (a) all loss, damage, theft, delay, or destruction in connection with the shipment and
                    delivery of any item(s) to TGA (even if TGA provides a shipping label for shipment of the item(s));
                    (b) obtaining or foregoing insurance coverage on your item while in transit; and (c) the expense of
                    the delivery and shipment of the item(s). TGA bears no responsibility for any item until it has been
                    unpacked, identified, and indicated as “Order Prep” by TGA; the carrier’s completion of delivery
                    shall have no effect on TGA’s responsibility, even if TGA signed for the package. For return
                    shipment following completion of TGA Grading Services or upon rejection of an item, you may at your
                    option: (a) have TGA ship and insure the applicable item and charge you for such insurance, (b)
                    obtain your own insurance, or (c) ship through your own shipping account, which means TGA will not
                    insure your outbound package. With respect to any item insured by TGA for return shipment, the
                    provisions of Section 10 shall apply.

                </p>
                <p>6. Additional Terms for TGA Inbound Shipping Program. For avoidance of doubt, any inbound shipping
                    option made available to you (including insured and non-insured shipping options) remains subject to
                    all of the General Shipping Requirements in Section 5, including but not limited to the TGA
                    submission instructions and requirements referenced there. You will receive a digital QR code to
                    ship your package via Canada Post or UPS to TGA. Your package must be taken to a physical Canada
                    Post or UPS location for drop off, scanning, and to obtain a receipt. Even when utilizing this
                    shipping option, however, shipping and carrier services under this option are at all times being
                    provided exclusively by Canada Post or UPS, never TGA. You understand that those services are being
                    provided to you by Canada Post or UPS under an arrangement between you and Canada Post or UPS. By
                    utilizing this service, you agree to accept financial responsibility for the inbound shipping
                    charges as shown and agreed. To understand Canada Post or UPS’s applicable terms and conditions,
                    rules and requirements, and packaging guidelines, please visit their respective websites.</p>
                <p>7. Return and Inspection of Submitted Items. You agree to timely report any issues with the return of
                    your items as specified below. If you do not receive your return shipment(s), you must notify TGA
                    within seventeen (17) calendar days of the original estimated date of delivery or, if no such
                    estimated date was provided, thirty (30) calendar days from the date TGA shipped your order. Upon
                    receipt of your return shipment(s), you must promptly and carefully inspect all submitted items
                    returned to you and report any damage, discrepancy, or errors to TGA in writing within five (5)
                    calendar days after receipt. You must also inspect all certification labels, and associated
                    authentication and grading documents (including those posted to the TGA website) (even if you elect
                    to transfer an item to the TGA Vault) immediately upon receipt for typographical, clerical, or
                    mechanical errors pertaining to the description of the item, which include, but are not limited to,
                    incorrect date or designation. You may review card images and verify certifications for paid,
                    processed orders directly on your TGA “Orders” page. You agree to submit a Label Correction Request
                    to the Customer Request Center and return any incorrectly described item to TGA upon request at any
                    time for correction of the discrepancy or error, at TGA’s expense, and agree to indemnify and hold
                    harmless TGA and its affiliates against all losses and/or claims (including attorney’s fees) caused
                    by the circulation or sale of a mismarked or inappropriate item or any unauthorized use of a TGA
                    certificate or label. TGA’s determination as to whether there exists any damage, discrepancy, or
                    error shall be final and binding. TGA disclaims any liability for damage or discrepancies or errors,
                    including, but not limited to, errors in the description of the item unless reported to TGA within
                    five (5) calendar days as specified in this section. If you elect to have your item transferred to
                    the TGA Vault, the terms referenced in Section 19 also apply.</p>
                <p>8. TGA Grading Services Disclaimer. TGA Grading Services (including authentication, grading and
                    certification) involve individual judgments that are subjective and require the exercise of
                    professional opinions, which can change from time to time. Therefore, TGA makes no warranty or
                    representation and shall have no liability whatsoever to you or any third party for any opinion
                    rendered, grade assigned, or statement made (including Grader Notes as defined in Section 23, below)
                    with respect to an item. If you disagree with the results of the TGA Grading Services for your
                    submitted item, you may resubmit the item for review and you will be responsible for the full
                    grading fees and applicable shipping charges. Any Grader Notes TGA may provide are intended for
                    illustrative purposes only and are not meant as exhaustive documentation of the TGA Grading
                    Services.</p>
                <p>9. TGA Item Holders. If you break open any TGA holder for an item, you shall immediately return to
                    TGA the TGA certification label and TGA holder. TGA certification labels and holders at all times
                    shall remain the property of TGA. If you come into possession of any TGA holder or label which you
                    have reason to believe is not completely sealed, tampered with, mislabeled, or counterfeit, you
                    shall immediately return such TGA holder or label to TGA. You acknowledge and agree that breaking
                    items out of TGA holders involves the risk of personal injury, including without limitation,
                    possible eye damage, and the risk of damaging the item. TGA SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER TO
                    YOU OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY OR DAMAGE TO ANY ITEM, OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING
                    FROM THE BREAKING OPEN OF A TGA HOLDER. If any item is removed, inadvertently or intentionally, from
                    its TGA holder, it shall be treated by you and TGA as if it were never graded by TGA, and you
                    acknowledge that such item may no longer qualify for TGA Grading Services. Once submitted, TGA shall
                    have no obligation to assign to a graded item the same grade previously assigned to it, and any
                    Guarantee that previously applied to the item while it was in the TGA holder shall no longer apply
                    to it.
                    B. Trust and Protection
                </p>
                <p>
                    10. Lost, Stolen, or Damaged Items. TGA will exercise reasonable and ordinary care in handling items
                    submitted for authentication, grading, review, or reholdering. However, if TGA determines, in its
                    sole discretion, that your item submitted to TGA for TGA Grading Services was lost, stolen, or
                    damaged while in the possession or control of TGA, TGA will compensate you as provided in this
                    Section 10 based upon the fair market value of the item at the time of loss as determined by TGA
                    standard procedures, which may include filing a claim with our insurance carrier. The Declared Value
                    you provide with the submission form for your item is only an estimate of the insured value, and the
                    fair market value of the item may be less than your Declared Value. IN NO EVENT SHALL TGA’S TOTAL
                    LIABILITY, WHETHER CAUSED BY THE ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE OF TGA OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE LESSER
                    OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OR THE DECLARED VALUE OF THE ITEM. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, IN OUR SOLE
                    DISCRETION, TO DETERMINE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR AN ITEM THROUGH ANY MEANS AS WE MAY DETERMINE.
                    TGA may elect, depending on the condition of a damaged item, to either (a) return the item to you
                    and compensate you for the reduction in value due to damage, or (b) retain the item and pay the
                    maximum liability available under this section.
                    Please be aware such compensation shall be your sole and exclusive remedy and our entire liability
                    for any loss or damage to your item while in the custody and control of TGA, and is subject to your
                    irrevocable release and discharge of TGA and its affiliates, on your behalf and on behalf of anyone
                    who may claim through or for you, from any liability for loss or damage to the item, including due
                    to the gross negligence of TGA or it agents and contractors. You must sign TGA’s standard Release of
                    Claims Agreement as a condition of payment. TGA reserves the right to withhold any claim
                    settlements, credits, or other amounts payable to you if you have outstanding amounts payable to
                    TGA, and TGA may discount such amounts payable to TGA from any amount payable to you.

                    TGA has and will have no liability whatsoever to you for any loss or damage of any item occurring
                    while the item is not in the custody or control of TGA, including, without limitation, after the
                    item is transferred to the custody or control of a third party, including another facility, owner,
                    agent, dealer, group submitter, or carrier, as identified by you, or released for return to you. TGA
                    will not be liable or responsible for any consequential, incidental, special, or indirect damages,
                    including, without limitation, for any intrinsic or sentimental value of an item.
                    If an item is reported lost or stolen by the owner or transport carrier, TGA may request a police
                    report or carrier claim as proof of loss in order to deactivate the certification numbers displayed
                    on our website. If you possess a deactivated cert, please contact our Customer Care team for
                    direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    11. Your Representations and Authorization. By submitting an item, you represent and warrant that
                    (a) the information stated on the submission form and any pictures or images of the item(s),
                    including, without limitation, the description and quality of each item, the condition of the item,
                    and the Declared Value are current, truthful and accurate and (b) the item is free and clear of any
                    liens, security interests, or encumbrances of any kind. If you are submitting any items that belong
                    to a third party, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to submit the items on behalf of
                    that third party, subject to these terms. You agree to provide to TGA written confirmation of such
                    authorization at any time upon our request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    12. Doctored and Inauthentic Items; Fraud Prevention and Investigation.

                    (a) You represent and warrant that any item submitted for any TGA Grading Service is genuine and you
                    have no knowledge and no reasonable basis to believe that the item is a “Doctored” item. You affirm
                    your obligations with respect to Doctored items set forth in these Terms. For purposes of these
                    Terms, “Doctor,” “Doctored” or “Doctoring” means the alteration of the appearance of an item by
                    things such as, but not limited to, trimming, re-coloring, bleaching, power erasing, cleaning,
                    waxing, re-backing or any other form of restoration used to enhance the appearance, condition or
                    content of an item.

                    (b) You agree that you will not Doctor items or participate in any way in Doctoring items or
                    submitting any items to TGA for grading which you know or have reason to believe have been Doctored
                    in any way, and acknowledge that the determination as to whether an item should be authenticated or
                    graded shall be made solely by TGA in accordance with its standards. You acknowledge that detecting
                    Doctored items is very difficult. You acknowledge that TGA will not authenticate or grade items
                    which, in the judgment of TGA, bear evidence of Doctoring. However, because the determination by TGA
                    to reject such Doctored items will require a review by TGA’s personnel, you will be required to
                    remit, as set forth herein, the standard fee for any such Doctored items that are submitted to TGA.
                    You acknowledge that Doctoring is wrongful and inappropriate activity which is harmful to TGA, and
                    all of your obligations in this Section 12 shall survive termination of these TGA Terms.

                    (c) You acknowledge that TGA will not grade counterfeit items. However, because the determination by
                    TGA to reject such counterfeit items will require a review by TGA’s personnel, you will be required
                    to remit, as set forth herein, the standard fee for any such items that are submitted to TGA. Such
                    items will not be placed in a TGA holder.

                    (d) You agree that TGA would suffer irreparable damages if you were to engage in Doctoring of any
                    item and that TGA is entitled to not only compensatory damages but also preliminary and final
                    injunctive relief for any breach of your obligation not to Doctor items or to submit Doctored items
                    to TGA in violation of your obligations hereunder.

                    (e) You acknowledge that TGA will not assign a numerical grade to any Doctored Item or item which,
                    in the judgment of TGA, bears evidence of harsh cleaning, artificial toning, damaged surfaces,
                    altered surfaces, foreign substances, or other similar impairments, or appears to be of questionable
                    authenticity. However, because the determination by TGA to reject such impaired items will require a
                    review by TGA’s personnel, TGA will not refund the standard fee for any such items that are
                    submitted to TGA.

                    (f) You agree that, if TGA determines that an encapsulated item in its possession (whether for TGA
                    Grading Services, corrections, Guarantee claims, or any other circumstance) is inauthentic,
                    incorrectly graded, altered, or damaged in its holder, TGA may remove the item from its holder and
                    change the grade/label as it deems appropriate. TGA will not in any circumstances return an
                    overgraded item with a label reflecting the originally assigned TGA grade to the extent that TGA has
                    determined that the grade is incorrect. Nor will TGA return any item in a TGA holder to the extent
                    that TGA has determined that the item is inauthentic.


                    (g) You acknowledge that TGA will not grade or authenticate certain items. TGA RESERVES THE RIGHT,
                    AT ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, TO REJECT ANY ITEM SUBMITTED BY YOU AND NOT TO GRADE OR
                    AUTHENTICATE SUCH ITEM. The refund of any fee for such a rejected item will be in TGA’s sole
                    discretion based on the circumstances. Such items will not be placed in a TGA holder.

                    (h) You agree that TGA may take the following measures regarding any submitted item that (i) is in a
                    TGA holder which has been opened or otherwise tampered with since being sealed, (ii) is in a
                    counterfeit holder or has a tampered or counterfeit label, or (iii) is a counterfeit item. You
                    further agree to immediately notify TGA if you have reason to believe any such item(s) are included
                    with your submission. If such item is in a TGA holder which is counterfeit or has been tampered, TGA
                    may remove such item from the counterfeit or compromised holder, confiscate the holder, and return
                    the item to you (and such item shall not be subject to the Guarantee (as defined above)). If such an
                    item is counterfeit, TGA may (i) remove such item from the TGA holder and (ii) take any action with
                    respect to such item required by applicable law, including, but not limited to, retaining such item
                    for an indefinite period of time or turning it over to the appropriate authorities for further
                    investigation.

                    (i) You authorize TGA to disclose your identifying information, records of your activities, and
                    other personal information (“Your Information”) to third parties if TGA reasonably believes, in its
                    sole discretion, that such disclosure may prevent or mitigate criminal activity or fraud. You
                    further acknowledge and agree that TGA may disclose Your Information to third parties in order to
                    conduct or aid the investigation of suspected criminal activity or fraud. Examples of fraud include,
                    but are not limited to, engaging in or supporting counterfeiting, tampering, sheet cutting, card
                    doctoring and mislabeling.

                    (j) TGA may apply the provisions of this Section 12 whenever it ascertains that you or your item is
                    subject to them, including after your item has been encapsulated and returned to you.
                    Notwithstanding any other remedy under these Terms, TGA may at any time deactivate the certification
                    label on any previously graded item or holder it believes to be Doctored, counterfeit, tampered
                    with, cleaned, altered, or otherwise handled in violation of these Terms.

                    13. TGA Authenticity and Grade Guarantee. The TGA Authenticity and Grade Guarantee (“Guarantee”)
                    applies to a TGA authenticated and graded card that had an active TGA certification number at the
                    time it was purchased by the person submitting the Guarantee request. You acknowledge and agree that
                    the Guarantee does not apply to, and cannot be utilized by, the original submitter (or the original
                    submitter’s agents, employees, affiliates or representatives, including a group submitter or dealer)
                    of the graded card. TGA reserves the right to investigate the relationship between the person making
                    the TGA Guarantee request and the original submitter.

                </p>
                <p>
                    14. TGA Certification Verification Services. TGA provides access to the TGA Cert Verification
                    Database for the sole purpose of confirming data regarding authenticated and graded items with a
                    particular certification number. You acknowledge and agree that verification of certification
                    numbers via the Database does not eliminate risk. TGA does not view authenticated items listed
                    online and does not warrant or guarantee that any such authenticated item is, in fact, a genuine TGA
                    authenticated item. TGA encourages the purchase of TGA verified collectibles from trustworthy
                    sources.

                    C. Payments
                </p>
                <p>
                    15. Payment Terms; Cancellations and Refunds. You agree upon submission of an item to pay all fees
                    and charges due and payable for the requested TGA Grading Services. Fees and charges must be paid
                    before TGA finishes processing your order, reveals the grades of items in your order, or returns
                    your items to you. Fees and charges paid to TGA are non-refundable except as indicated in this
                    section. All fees and charges are applicable regardless of outcome. In the event TGA rejects an item
                    you submitted for TGA Grading Services for any reason, TGA has no obligation to cancel any amounts
                    payable at submission (or refund any amounts paid), as the determination to reject an item requires
                    a review by TGA's graders and authenticators and use of their professional opinion. Occasionally,
                    personnel providing the applicable services for autograph or photograph submissions cannot express
                    an opinion on an item. Such items will be designated as “Inconclusive” and a refund may be issued in
                    the full amount of the authentication price (less expenses for preparation, release and delivery of
                    the item(s) (which may include a processing, shipping and handling charge as applied by TGA)).

                    Items are eligible for cancellation only before review by a TGA grader has commenced. You may
                    request cancellation of TGA Grading Services by contacting TGA in writing and requesting the return
                    of your submitted item(s). Upon receipt of your request for cancellation of eligible items, and
                    subject to TGA’s then-current operating procedures, we will (a) cancel the TGA Grading Services and
                    prepare to (i) release your item(s) to you or your designated agent or representative or (ii)
                    arrange for delivery of the item(s) via insured delivery to a physical delivery address you specify
                    at your expense, and (b) cancel any amounts payable (or refund any amounts paid) for the TGA Grading
                    Services. IMPORTANT: Return of the items you submitted with a canceled order is conditioned on your
                    payment to TGA for expenses incurred for preparation, release, and delivery (including any
                    processing, shipping and handling charges). Once a TGA grader has commenced review of an item, the
                    TGA Grading Services selected for that item cannot be canceled.

                    If you cause payment for TGA Grading Services to be rescinded after TGA has processed your items and
                    returned them to you, TGA will consider such items unpaid and may at its discretion deactivate their
                    certifications until you remit payment.

                    16. Payment Authorization. You represent and warrant that you are the cardholder or authorized user
                    of the payment method(s) you provide, and you authorize TGA to (a) charge the payment method for the
                    Final Amount Due (defined below) in connection with your order and (b) store and use the payment
                    method and certain related information for future orders and charges in connection with the
                    authentication and grading services provided by TGA. You further authorize TGA to charge the payment
                    method for any additional service you may select during the TGA Online Submission process or
                    otherwise via the TGA website, including TGA Vault services. You further acknowledge and agree that
                    TGA may validate any payment method you provide to TGA in connection with the Services to ensure
                    that the payment method is valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction. You
                    understand that your card issuer may hold the authorized amount for a period of time determined by
                    your card issuer.


                    The “Final Amount Due” is equal to the price of the Service Level you select multiplied by the
                    number of items in the order, adjusted to account for the Service Level price applicable to any item
                    for which TGA determines its value to exceed the maximum Declared Value for the Service Level you
                    selected (see also Section 2, above). Accordingly, if after grading and processing your submitted
                    items, TGA determines that the value of any item exceeds the maximum Declared Value allowed for the
                    Service Level you selected, the Final Amount Due will reflect the higher cost of the Service Level
                    appropriate for each such item. YOU AUTHORIZE TGA TO CHARGE THE FINAL AMOUNT DUE TO YOUR PAYMENT
                    METHOD WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU OR FURTHER AUTHORIZATION BY YOU, SO LONG AS SUCH AMOUNT DOES NOT EXCEED
                    YOUR ESTIMATED ORDER TOTAL AT CHECKOUT BY MORE THAN (1) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500) OR (2) A LESSER
                    AMOUNT DISCLOSED TO YOU DURING ORDER SUBMISSION. All charges will be made in CANADIAN dollars ($
                    CAD).


                    You agree that the authorization provided by you for TGA to store and use the payment method and
                    related information you provide for future orders and charges will remain in effect until canceled
                    by you. You may cancel such authorization in the payment methods screen in the TGA Online Submission
                    process, or by contacting TGA via phone or written message using the contact information provided in
                    Section 28 below. These contact methods are also suitable for any other payment- or
                    transaction-related questions you may have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    17. Delinquent Payments and TGA’s Security Interest. You agree (a) to pay to TGA all pricing and
                    other charges when due; (b) that any delinquent balances shall accrue interest at the rate of 10%
                    per year until paid (or, if less, the maximum interest rate permitted by applicable law); and (c)
                    that TGA shall have a security interest in the items submitted, as well as in any other property of
                    yours in the possession of TGA or its affiliates (collectively, the “Property”), to secure your
                    payment obligations hereunder. You hereby grant to TGA an assignment of and lien against the
                    Property in the amount of any fees and other charges due and payable pursuant to these Terms for the
                    applicable TGA Grading Services. You hereby authorize TGA to file, at any time on or after the date
                    such pricing totals and other charges become due, appropriate uniform commercial code financing
                    statements in such jurisdictions and offices as TGA deems necessary in connection with the
                    perfection of a security interest in the Property. If you do not pay all obligations due under these
                    Terms, TGA will execute its security interest in your submitted item(s) by selling or otherwise
                    disposing of such item(s) and applying any proceeds to the delinquent balance.

                <p>21. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE TERMS OF THE USER AGREEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO ALL
                    OF THE TGA GRADING SERVICES, THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THESE TGA TERMS ARE IN LIEU OF ALL
                    WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, HEREBY ARE DISCLAIMED AND

                    or warranties contrary to these TGA Terms and any additional statement, including without
                    limitation, statements made by any TGA personnel or employees or those made in any advertising or
                    presentation materials (oral or written) do no constitute representations and warranties by TGA and
                    should not be relied upon as such.</p>
                <p>22. Limitation of Liability. TGA shall have no liability whatsoever to you, or any third party for
                    whom you may be acting, (a) for any personal injury or (b) any damage to any item, or otherwise,
                    resulting from the breaking open of a TGA holder, or for any damage to any item that occurred while
                    the item was not in the custody or control of TGA, including, but not limited to, loss or damage to
                    items while being shipped to TGA, or while being shipped by TGA to you under your own personal
                    shipping courier account and insurance.

                    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except as otherwise set forth herein if
                    TGA determines that your item was lost or damaged while in TGA's possession, WITHOUT LIMITING THE
                    TERMS OF THE USER AGREEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE MAXIMUM
                    AGGREGATE LIABILITY THAT TGA SHALL HAVE TO YOU, OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR WHOM YOU MAY BE ACTING,
                    ARISING FROM ANY CAUSE, ACT, OMISSION OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE, WHETHER CAUSED BY THE ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
                    NEGLIGENCE OF TGA OR OTHERWISE, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE FEES AND CHARGES OR LESS ACTUALLY PAID
                    BY YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE TGA GRADING SERVICES RENDERED BY TGA WITH RESPECT TO THE ITEMS SUBMITTED
                    FOR TGA GRADING SERVICES HEREUNDER. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO
                    EVENT SHALL TGA OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS,
                    DIRECTORS OR AGENTS, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES OR LEGAL OR
                    EQUITABLE THEORY, FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY
                    DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF MONEY, GOODWILL OR REPUTATION, COSTS
                    OF DELAY OR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGE, OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES OR ANY INTRINSIC OR
                    SENTIMENTAL VALUE OF AN ITEM, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, PERSONAL INJURY, BODILY INJURY, PROPERTY
                    DAMAGE, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, DEATH, REAL OR PROPERTY DAMAGE), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
                    SUCH DAMAGES.

                <p>
                    23. Data and Image Canadage. In the ordinary course of its operations, TGA (a) compiles data
                    regarding each item submitted for authentication and/or grading, including, but not limited to, data
                    relating to the identity, production, condition and grade of the item (the “Data”); (b) may take,
                    have taken, or otherwise collect one or more digital or other types of photographs, images, videos
                    or reproductions of each such item (collectively, the “Images”); and/or (c) may provide you access
                    to notes that describe the grade or condition of such item(s), which may include, without
                    limitation, text and modified versions of the Images (collectively, the “Grader Notes” and together
                    with the Data and Images, the “Grading Content”). In consideration for the TGA Grading Services
                    being provided by TGA, you, on your own behalf and that of any third party for whom you may be
                    acting, hereby authorize TGA (a) to compile and maintain such Data with respect to each item
                    submitted hereunder for authentication and/or grading; and (b) to take, cause to be taken, or
                    otherwise collect one or more Images of each such item. You furthermore agree that TGA will be the
                    exclusive owner of all Grading Content and that TGA may use and exploit such Grading Content for
                    commercial and any other purposes, as TGA in its sole discretion deems appropriate, including, but
                    not limited to, the publication and republication or reproduction in or on any media, of such
                    Grading Content. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you, on your own behalf and that
                    of any third party for whom you may be acting with respect to these Terms, unconditionally and
                    irrevocably transfer, convey and assign to TGA any and all current and any hereafter acquired
                    rights, title and interests (including, without limitation, rights in copyright, patent, trade
                    secret and trademark) that you or any such third party may have in or to the Grading Content (on
                    whatever media or in whatever form such Images may be reproduced or published). Notwithstanding the
                    foregoing, TGA grants Customer a limited, revocable license to use the Grader Notes for personal
                    use, and to display, publish, or restate the Grader Notes (including an image thereof) for an item
                    alongside a statement of the grade or image of the TGA certification label for that item, so long as
                    Customer (a) represents the content of the Grader Notes in a complete and accurate manner and (b)
                    clearly identifies the specific item to which such Grader Notes apply. Otherwise, Customer may not,
                    whether or not through a third party, directly or indirectly publish, publicly display, recreate,
                    sublicense, or create derivative works from any of the Grader Notes in any manner whatsoever without
                    the prior written consent of TGA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    24. Indemnification. Without limiting the terms of the User Agreement, you agree to indemnify and
                    reimburse us and any third-party service provider engaged by us for all claims, costs, losses,
                    damages, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses incurred by us or brought against
                    us by any third party arising out of or relating to (a) your breach of these TGA Terms or the User
                    Agreement, including, without limitation, any violation of any TGA policies applicable to the TGA
                    Grading Services; (b) your violation of any law or regulation or the rights of any third party; (c)
                    your access to or use any TGA Grading Services; and (d) your negligence, willful misconduct, or
                    fraud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    25. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the User
                    Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that the TGA Grading Services are delivered and these TGA Terms
                    are accepted in the Province of British Columbia and it is the intention of the parties that it be
                    governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of that State, without regard to
                    conflicts of laws principles. THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION SET FORTH IN THE USER AGREEMENT
                    SETS FORTH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT FOR
                    ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND/OR CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE
                    TGA TERMS AND THE TGA GRADING SERVICES.
                </p>
                <p>
                    26. Force Majeure. TGA shall not be considered liable or responsible to you or deemed to have
                    defaulted or breach these TGA Terms and TGA shall be entitled to an extension of the date of any
                    performance required of TGA under these TGA Terms if the failure of TGA to perform was because of a
                    Force Majeure Event. “Force Majeure Event” shall be an act of God, riot, war, civil unrest, hostile
                    fire, flood, earthquake, interruption of services (including without limitation transportation and
                    utility services) or other cause beyond TGA’s reasonable control and anticipation (including without
                    limitation, any mechanical, electronic, or communications failure), or any inability due to the
                    aforementioned causes to obtain necessary labor, materials, facilities or products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    27. Miscellaneous. The terms and provisions in these TGA Terms and the User Agreement (and other
                    terms referenced herein, as applicable), constitute the entire agreement of TGA and you (and any
                    third party for whom you may be acting) regarding the TGA Grading Services identified herein, and
                    supersede all prior agreements and understandings (written or oral) between or among such parties
                    relating thereto (with the exception of the User Agreement which remains applicable and controls).
                    If it is determined that there are any inconsistencies between these TGA Terms and the User
                    Agreement, then the documents will control in this order of precedence: the User Agreement and the
                    TGA Terms. If any term or provision of the TGA Terms is determined, by a final and non-appealable
                    ruling or order of a court of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid or unenforceable under
                    applicable law, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability
                    of any of the other terms or provisions of these terms and conditions. Your rights and obligations
                    under these Terms may not be assigned or transferred without the prior written consent of TGA. Each
                    party shall execute and deliver such additional documents and instruments as any other party may
                    request to better evidence or effectuate the agreements contained herein, including the assignment
                    of rights set forth herein, and procedures, and further agree that TGA is entitled to rely upon and
                    benefit from those terms and procedures.
                </p>
