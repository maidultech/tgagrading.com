                    categories of recipients:

                    • Affiliates. We may share personal information with TGA’ affiliates.
                    • Service Providers. We may share information with service providers and business partners who
                    provide services to us or otherwise help us operate our business or the Services, such as (without
                    limitation) by hosting data or our Services, helping us send newsletters, processing payments, and
                    detecting and preventing payment and other fraud.
                    • Other TGA and Users, or the General Public. Our Services may enable you to share information about
                    your collectibles with other TGA or the public, or to offer your collectibles for sale, such as by
                    (a) posting information about your collectibles on our Services, and/or (b) listing collectibles for
                    sale via a publicly-accessible marketplace. In such cases, as applicable, your information
                    (including information you provide about your collectible(s)) may be accessible to other TGA or to
                    the general public. Similarly, if you post about, bid on, or purchase a collectible, your
                    information may became publicly available, and/or may be shared with the seller of the collectible.
                    Lastly, if you participate in our user fora and/or message boards, anything you post may be viewed
                    by other users or the public, as applicable.
                    • Event-related Sharing. If you register for an event we organize, we may share your personal
                    information in connection with enabling your participation in the event, such as (for instance) by
                    sharing your name with the facility where the event is occurring. Your information may, to the
                    extent permitted by law, be shared with other event participants.
                    • Compliance- and Security-related Transfers. We may share personal information with third parties
                    in connection with (a) complying with, establishing, asserting, exercising, defending against, or
                    enforcing any legal claims, legal rights, legal obligations, legal process, TGA policies, government
                    requests, or prudent security or business practices; (b) protecting the health, safety, welfare,
                    rights, or interests of you, us, any third party, or the general public; or (c) protecting the
                    safety and integrity of our Services, troubleshooting issues, and detecting and preventing errors,
                    fraudulent activity, or other potentially wrongful, harmful, or illegal activity. This may include
                    disclosures to other TGA, businesses, insurance companies, law enforcement, third-party owners, or
                    others.
                    • As You Direct. We may share information with other companies to whom you request that we share it.
                    For instance, our Services may enable you to designate others authorized to act on your behalf; if
                    so, we share information about you with such third parties.
                    • Business Transactions. We may share or transfer information with another business in connection
                    with a merger, acquisition, or sale of our assets.

                    V. How We Secure Your Information: The TGA Cybersecurity Team is responsible for securing your
                    information. We employ industry best practices intended to safeguard data from misuse, unauthorized

                    encryption, multi-factor authentication, and regular penetration testing. We apply an adaptive
                    risk-based approach to security, ensuring resilience against evolving threats while complying with
                    applicable laws and regulations. We have established an incident response protocol to minimize the
                    impact of security incidents. These controls are strengthened by a security training and awareness
                    program for all employees.

                    many companies that operate online, we may at times engage vendors that leverage your data for
                    targeted advertising on our behalf. Under certain province laws this may result in us “sharing” your
                    data for “targeted advertising” that you can opt-out from. We may share identifiers, internet and
                    other electronic activity information, and inferences with ad networks, social media providers, or
                    advertising providers for this purpose. We do not knowingly sell or share personal information of

                    collected from you. Please note that exercising this right may affect our ability to provide you
                    Services that require us to have certain Personal Information about you.
                    • Opt-Out of Sharing for Targeted Advertising. To opt-out of sharing for targeted advertising that

                    honored if in the future we do so.


                    Some province laws may grant you a right to appeal a denial of your rights request. If this is
                    applicable to you, our response to your request will provide details on how to submit an appeal.
                    We do not process sensitive personal information in a way that requires us to provide a “Right to
                    Limit” use or disclosure of sensitive information. As required by applicable law, we will not
                    discriminate against you because of your exercise of any of the above rights.

                    information, and other information necessary to help verify your identity. If we cannot verify your
                    identity, or if another applicable law prevents us from fulfilling your request, we may deny your
                    request.
                </p>
                <p>X. Changes to this Privacy Notice: We may modify this Privacy Notice from time to time, and will post
